## Inspiration üß†
The inspiration behind Recykle was to bridge the gap between recycling companies and consumers. I aimed to create a platform that seamlessly connects users and recycling hospitals, providing efficient healthcare solutions. This project was fueled by the desire to address real-time recycling challenges using cutting-edge technology.

## What it does ‚ùî
Recykle is a comprehensive recycling application designed to serve both users and recycling companies. Users can access personalized dashboards to manage their recycling information, book recycling requests, and stay connected with recycling companies. Recyling companies, on the other hand, benefit from a dedicated dashboard that streamlines users management, appointment scheduling, and overall recycling administration.

## How we built it üñ•Ô∏è
Recykle was built using a stack of modern technologies. The front end is powered by React and Tailwindcss providing a robust user interface. To manage state and data, we adopted React Context API, which was a significant learning experience as it was the first time we used them for a large-scale project.

On the backend, I used Google Firebase to store the user and recycling companies data. I also integrated Firestore for realtime updates for recycling companies and users.

During the development process, we encountered a few challenges, including initial setup hurdles with Firestore. However, I persevered, learned valuable lessons, and overcame these obstacles.

## Challenges we ran into üèÉ
We faced some initial challenges, particularly in configuring and integrating Firestore and Google Authentication. The learning curve for this powerful tool was steep, but through perseverance and dedicated problem-solving, Additionally, handling real-time data and state management in a recycling context presented unique challenges, which we tackled by enhancing our understanding of React Context API and Firestore

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üöÄ
One of the most notable accomplishments is mastering Firebase and Firestore and also using Tailwindcss for a significant project. This was the first time we utilized these technologies extensively, and the resulting efficient state management was a major achievement.

## What we learned üìñ
Throughout the development of Recykle, we learned invaluable lessons. Our proficiency in Firebase and Firestore improved significantly, allowing us to efficiently manage and synchronize application data.

Incorporating React and Tailwindcss into our development stack also broadened my knowledge and empowered me to build a large-scale application with improved performance and SEO capabilities. I am proud of the expertise I gained and look forward to applying these skills in future projects.
